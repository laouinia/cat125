                        Abdelkader Laouini, a.k.a <em class="la">L.A.</em>, is currently a third-year Electrical and
                        Computer Engineer
                        student at the Jacobs School
                        of Engineering, University of California San Diego. He will graduate in December 2021 with a
                        Bachelor’s in Electrical
                        and Computer Engineering.

                    <p class="tab">
                        <em class="la">L.A.</em>’s fascination with computers and programming began as a youngster in
                        Tunisia where he
                        taught himself how to use and
                        fix computers. During his senior year in high school, he accepted his first job as a customer
                        service representative in
                        a cybercafe. This opportunity strengthened his passion for providing technical support and good
                        service to his
                        customers.

                    <br>

                    <p class="tab">
                        After obtaining an International Baccalaureate in Math, he worked in a small company that
                        offered IT solutions for
                        individuals and small businesses. He sharpened his skillset and ability to better support his
                        customers by picking up
                        several skills, which included, software and hardware solutions as well as computer networking.
                        After years of
                        experience and hard work, he was promoted to a managerial position within the company. A
                        position where he naturally
                        excelled due to his drive, extensive technical knowledge and strong commitment to customer
                        satisfaction.

                    <p class="tab">
                        The next chapter in <em class="la">L.A.</em>’s life led him to the United States of America
                        where he earned an
                        opportunity to work for
                        Apple, a renowned company at the forefront of the world’s technical industry. He worked as an
                        Expert in Sales at the
                        Pentagon City Apple store, in Northern Virginia. During a three-year period working for Apple,
                        <em class="la">L.A.</em> was constantly the
                        top producer in nationwide sales, an award measured by revenue gains.

                    <p class="tab">
                        Working for Apple took his skill set and customer service skills to yet another level. <em
                            class="la">L.A.</em>
                        quickly became the reliable
                        go-to peer when regular or business customers needed support for more complex issues. While
                        juggling his full-time
                        position with Apple, <em class="la">L.A.</em> decided to pursue a Computer Engineering degree to
                        bolster his
                        computer and programming
                        knowledge. He started this journey by taking classes at Northern Virginia Community College then
                        Mesa College once he
                        moved to San Diego, California.

                    <p class="tab">
                        <em class="la">L.A.</em>’s goal is for his reputation to precede him as a subject matter expert
                        in the IT industry.
                        He hopes to make an
                        impact on efforts to bridge the gap between non-technical managers and engineers. Further, his
                        background and success as
                        a manager in the field, along with his ability to speak the engineering language as well as
                        Arabic, French, and Italian
                        will surely make him a strong asset to any company in the IT industry.
