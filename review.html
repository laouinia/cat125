                    The Coming Software Apocalypse is the article I am going to review. In his article, James Somers
                    exposes the hidden
                    sides of software engineering and the direct consequences of bad software engineering practice. The
                    examples
                    mentioned in his article were scarry and if we do not take action things can get worse. Please take
                    the time to read
                    my detailed review. - Thank you - <br>

                    <p class="tab">
                        I agree with Somers. It is inevitable that the “Software Apocalypse” is coming. The article
                        is almost five years old. Considering what happened in the world in the last few years, from
                        security breaches to system failures and how we depend more and more on software; the question
                        we, software engineers, should be asking is: How could we minimize the damage of a software
                        apocalypse?
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p class="tab">
                        In the article, Somers described the flows in programming and how they impacted us in
                        different ways, to name a few, the suspension of the New York Stock Exchange and the crash of
                        the 911 system. The problem of programming according to Somers is mainly caused by the
                        software engineers “Software engineers don’t understand the problem they’re trying to solve, and
                        don’t care to.” (Leveson). I think this is the biggest problem we are facing nowadays with
                        software
                        engineers. Most of us want to write code and we are experts in writing the code but at the same
                        time, we do not understand the requirements of the problem we are trying to solve.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p class="tab">
                        The article also mentioned that we know what are the problems of programming and how
                        to avoid them or at least we know how to write a reliable software but we are not doing anything
                        to prevent the apocalypse. “We already know how to make complex software reliable, but in so
                        many places, we’re choosing not to.” (Ledinot). The transition in programming languages from
                        hardware, machine, assembly, high-level, to C, Fortran… created a gap between the program and
                        the machine. It used to be easy to write machine language software and build a reliable program
                        but the transition to a more simplified ways to write code increased the gap between the machine
                        and the code.
                    </p>

                    <p class="tab">
                        In my opinion, the imminent threat of a “Software Apocalypse” is the result of a
                        combination of many factors. The education system, the demand for more software, the speed of
                        delivery of the final products and most importantly is that mathematical knowledge opened the
                        doors to many people who are not qualified to write reliable code. According to Bantegine,
                        coding
                        is not only the act of writing the code but the understanding of the requirements of the
                        problem:
                        “The people know how to code. The problem is what to code.” I can relate to this statement. I am
                        in my final stretch to obtain an Electric and Computer Engineering (ECE) degree from the
                        prestigious University of California, San Diego without taking, in my humble opinion, the most
                        important class for a Computer Science major or ECE major which is: “CSE 105: Introduction to
                        Theory of Computability.” The class introduces students to the basics of state machine. It is
                        the
                        fundamental key to solve problems or at least understand what is behind the requirement. It
                        should
                        be the prerequisite prior to writing a single line of code. I have been struggling in all the
                        classes
                        that require the concept of state machine just because I did not take CSE 105 as it is not a
                        requirement in the curriculum for an ECE major.
                    </p>

                    <p class="tab">
                        At the same time, the industry is now open to anyone who can sit in front of a computer
                        and knows how to write a code. With the democratization of integrated development environments
                        (IDE), writing code became a simple task. This is similar to the evolution of word processing. I
                        still remember Dr Hess, my English as Second Language (ESL) teacher, words: “Word processing
                        software is a pandemic in the English language.” She explained that using the software is not
                        the
                        problem. The software will underline the spelling mistakes and grammar, but it will not correct
                        your thoughts nor the use of a different correctly spelled word that has a different meaning.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p class="tab">
                        With the demand for software engineers, we saw an increase in “producing” them through
                        different means such as bootcamps and online classes that promise a job as a software engineer
                        in
                        12 weeks. How could that be possible? For the last few years, I focused in learning the basics
                        of
                        algorithms for software engineering therefore, I took many classes related to the subject, but I
                        still
                        feel like I have not even scratch the surface. I might not remember everything I learned in
                        those
                        courses, but I still remember the last thing the teacher mentioned in his last lecture
                        yesterday:
                        “Remember folks, this is an introductory course to Design and Analysis of Algorithms.”
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p class="tab">
                        As a future software engineer who cares about minimizing the damage of the imminent
                        threat of a “Software Apocalypse,” I have a list of books related to algorithms and computer
                        theories that I must read. I should be able to understand and utilize them to solve problems
                        before
                        writing a single line of code or even prior to applying for a job. It is my duty and
                        contribution in
                        order to minimize the damage. I think Lamport was talking about me when he said: “I hope people
                        won’t be allowed to write programs if they don’t understand these simple things.” To solve a
                        problem, we must understand it first.

                    <p class="tab">
                        To summarize, I use the following quote to help me every single day so I can improve as a
                        software engineer: “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers
                        write code that humans can understand” — Martin fowler. I hope that my fellow software
                        engineers follow this quote in order to be the good programmers that will save us from the
                        “Software Apocalypse.”
